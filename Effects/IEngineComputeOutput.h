// IEngineComputeOutput — engine-internal COM interface exposed by
// effects whose analysis output is GPU-resident in a structured buffer.
//
// Phase 8 GPU-binding architecture: when a compute analysis effect's
// output field feeds a downstream effect's parameter via the property-
// binding system, we want to route GPU→GPU instead of round-tripping
// through Map(). The evaluator detects this routing by QI'ing the
// upstream effect for this interface; effects that implement it expose
// the SRV of their structured-buffer output, and the evaluator binds
// it directly to the downstream effect's t-slot for the appropriate
// SHADERLAB_GPU_BUFFER prologue.
//
// Field layout (which Result[N] slot maps to which named field) is
// **NOT** part of this interface. It already lives in the graph data
// model on `EffectNode::analysisOutput.fields`. The evaluator has the
// EffectNode in hand at QI time, so duplicating the metadata across
// the COM boundary would only invite drift. This interface is narrow
// on purpose: just the runtime resource handles, in stable POD shape.
//
// Implementations: the D2D effect wrapper for the D3D11-compute path
// (Phase 8 -- still in progress as of this edit). Pixel-shader effects
// and the D2D-tiled compute path do NOT implement this interface --
// neither produces a structured-buffer SRV the evaluator could bind.
